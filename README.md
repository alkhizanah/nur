## Why Syphon?

Here is our main goals:

1. **Ease-Of-Use**: The syntax and features are made entirely to be easy to use, so you can focus more on scripting and stop thinking about the language you are scripting in
2. **Simplicity**: There is one way to do it, no semicolons, exceptionally readable by default
3. **Open-Software**: All of our software is open and maintainable in readable idiomatic Zig code
4. **Modern**: We learn from other's mistakes, therefore avoiding them which leads it to be as modern as it can get

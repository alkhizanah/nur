# Syphon

[Documentation](docs) - [Examples](examples)

A general-purpose programming language for scripting and all sort of stuff

## Why Syphon?

Here is our main goals:

1. **Community-Driven**: The syntax and features all being in control by the community, want something? add it or open an issue for someone else to add it
2. **Fast Performance**: The main goal to make it as fast as possible compared to other interpreted languages
3. **Simplicity**: There is one way to do it, no semicolons, exceptionally readable by default and easy to use `println` statements
4. **Open-Software**: All of our software is open and maintainable in readable idiomatic Zig code
5. **Modern**: We learn from other's mistakes, therefore avoiding them which leads it to be as modern as it can get

## Have you achieved any of those goals?

You would think "yeah, all people say that", and yes all people say that, we are some of those people, besides that, here is a little roadmap:

- **Is it community-driven?** Yes

- **Is it fast?** Not quite... But there is incremental improvements:

> Currently, on my Core2Duo E6300 machine I can get up to 700ms speed on average for fibonacci not-cached recursive function, morever, only a couple of microseconds for fibonacci cached recursive function, you can check up the benchmark [here](tests/benchmarks/fibonacci.sy)

- **How simple is it?** Yes

- **Is it open source?** Yes

- **Is it modern?** Yes

# The Time Built-in Module

## Expectations

I expect that you imported the time module like that

```
time = import("time")
```

## Functions

- now

Gives you the current time since the unix epoch in seconds

```
time.now() # 1719424371
```

- now_ms

Gives you the current time since the unix epoch in milliseconds

```
time.now() # 1719424371952
```
